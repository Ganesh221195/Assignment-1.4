1) characteristics of Big data in detail

they are 
1)volume - the quantity of data that is generated is very important.
           size of data determines the value and potential of data under consideration
           it referes to size of heterogeneous context


2)variety - big data belongs to is also a very essential fact that needs to be known by analysts
            this helps in analysing data and its associates 


3)velocity - it refers to speed of generation of data or how fast data is generated and processed to meet demands
             which lies in path of growth and development

4)value - having access to big data is no good unless we can turn it into value
          companies are starting to generate amazing value from their big data 

5)veracity - refers to the messiness or trustworthiness of data 
             with many forms of big data,quality and accuracy are less controllable

data comes in two forms

1)structured and 
2)unstructured data

=================================================================

2) possible solutions to handle Big data


the possible solutions to big data are
1)Hadoop
2)Oracle
3)Cassandra
4)Teradata

3)differences between scaling up and scaling out

Scaling up generally refers to purchasing and installing a more capable central control or piece of hardware
 a scaling up approach would be to buy a more capable server with more processing capacity and RAM

scaling out means linking together other lower-performance machines to collectively do the work of a much more advanced one
it's easy to handle a larger workload by running data through different system trajectories
